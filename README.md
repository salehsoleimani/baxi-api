## Database Design
we started by Defining our needs, analyzing system design and requirements, and breaking them into smaller pieces, a big epic into smaller so-called Entities, and using this to model the relations between entities and have a more efficient, premeditated database design. converting this model we can model our statement using tables.

## Why PostgreSQL & AsyncPG?
why did we choose PostgreSQL among all Relational DBMSs out there?
We needed high performance, low latency and additional features of PostgreSQL itself.
leveraging the PostgreSQL protocol directly Our prior encounter with uvloop demonstrated

> the capability of creating efficient and effective libraries using Cython. asyncpg is entirely crafted in Cython, integrating advanced memory management and optimization techniques. Consequently, asyncpg demonstrated an average speed enhancement of 3 times compared to psycopg2 (or aiopg).

you can compare the AsyncPG driver benchmark by [Magic Stack]([#why-fastapi-&-asyncpg?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMagicStack%2Fasyncpg&psig=AOvVaw3o0kzOn9-m7S1DhbDNbumH&ust=1710244836997000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBUQjhxqFwoTCKj1htKU7IQDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)) in the chart below:

## Why FastAPI & UVLoop?

> uvloop is a fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in asyncio event loop. It is implemented in Cython

considering different use cases in our project, working with database, let's compare it with other frameworks out there including nodejs and golang and mention fast api advantages and disadvantages over other frameworks:

### FastAPI's Performance in Comparison with Golang Gin, NestJS and ExpressJS

(I found these on the issues page of the official FastAPI repository)
> Gin is a web framework written in Golang. It features a Martini-like API, but with performance up to 40 times faster than Martini. If you need performance and productivity, you will love Gin.

> When considering FastAPI's performance in various scenarios compared to NestJS and ExpressJS, it's important to note that the choice of framework ultimately depends on specific use cases and workload requirements. Here's a brief overview of the findings based on TechEmpower's Round 19 benchmarks:

> - **Plain Text**: If the primary workload involves serving text, Golang is a perfect choice rather than fast api. FastAPI lags behind NestJS and ExpressJS in this scenario.

> - **Data Updates**: FastAPI excels in scenarios where requests involve fetching data from a database, updating it, and returning the results. It outperforms NestJS and ExpressJS in this area.

> - **Multiple Queries**: FastAPI performs slightly better than Gin when it comes to fetching multiple rows from a database and serializing the results. ExpressJS and NestJS lag behind in this scenario.

> - **Single Query**: For scenarios involving fetching and serializing a single row, Gin leads the pack, followed by FastAPI, NestJS, and ExpressJS in that order.

> - **JSON Serialization**: In tests focusing on JSON serialization without database activity, Gin outperforms the competition, with ExpressJS, NestJS, and FastAPI following suit.

In summary, FastAPI is a good choice in dealing with large amounts of data from a database, performing at a fast speed in such cases. However, its performance may vary in scenarios with less database activity and io operations which is related to async operations on the event loop, where Gin tends to be a better choice.


## Why Redis?
- **To handle OTP Expiration:** We use OTP-Based Authentication in our application, so we need to check the OTP code. OTP codes have a limited expiration time and if we store OTP codes also in our relational PostgreSQL database it would massively decrease our performance and it takes up a lot of RAM usage.
  ðŸ¤” but what if use a fast temporary dbms as a cache? which handles the expiration time itself and whenever the expiration comes destructs himself. well say hello to Redis.
- **To manage Tokens:** If we want to implement a revoke button for the user so whenever he needs to log out from his session, he can see, and manage the active sessions and revoke any of them if they sound malicious.. so it's necessary to have access to tokens besides their expiration date.

## Backend
The **backend** of Baxi is developed in Python Fast API, why Fast API? you might ask. well according to our needs and project, I explored different frameworks, and libraries such as Nodejs, Python Flask or Django, and several other platforms besides several database drivers available in 2024 and I came to realize Fast API Async PG is the fastest choice I can make. according to what we discussed about in [Why Fast API & AsyncPG?](#why-fastapi-&-asyncpg?)

other key factors made Fast API the best choice we could have for our application, its framework providing high-performance Nodejs and Golang coming along with Python. and it was fun

we focused on a limited number of statements but tried to deeply dive into each one's best practices used by other developers in the community:
- **Authentication (Auth):** Manages user registration, verification, and login protecting against XSS-XSRF attacks using tokens:
    -  **Security:** Using rfc7519 standards, JWT tokens, rate limiting
    -  **Cache Radis:** Storing OTP Verification in Redis
    -  **Revoking Tokens:** Storing Access Tokens in Redis to have access to them, revoke tokens
    -  **Validation & Sanitizing:** Validating and sanitizing user input using Pydantic
    -  **Secure Tokens:** Providing and receiving tokens in the secure layers, HTTP only tookies and safe headers

here are our best practices for trying to have a maintainable code:
- **Repository Design Pattern:** Using Repository Design Patterns and data sources for a flexible design
- **DI Design Pattern:** Using Dependency Injection Design Pattern to have a dynamic and flexible depending

The backend leverages cutting-edge technologies like Docker, SQLAlchemy, AsyncPG, and Redis to provide a solid foundation for an online taxi platform.

## How to Run Docker
To get Baxi up and running in a docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/salehsoleimani/baxi-e-taxi`
2. **Build the Backend Docker Image:** `Make build`
3. **Run the Backend Docker Container:** `Make run`

## How to Run in Local
To get Baxi up and running in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/salehsoleimani/baxi-e-taxi`
2. **Create a python Venv:** `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. **Initialize baxi venv:** `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. **Install The requirements:** `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Serve the application using uvicorn and setting event loop work:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4000 --reload --loop uvloop --workers 1`

> [!NOTE]  
> for dependencies to work you need to set up the event loop and worker threads manually by the 6th command
